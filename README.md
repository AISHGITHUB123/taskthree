We have a nested object, we would like a function that you pass in the object and a key and get back the value. How this is implemented is up to you. Example Inputs object = {“a”:{“b”:{“c”:”d”}}} key = a/b/c object = {“x”:{“y”:{“z”:”a”}}} key = x/y/z value = a


Define a function that takes two parameters named

  object : the full JSON object keys : an Array of keys in the order
  
Written a python code to pass in the object which is in the form of full JSON object, keys with list of values to get back the value as per the object that is passed 

Please find the code in the file named code.py
